# Lexical Comments

Lexical is the most powerful and feature rich of the editors (Judging by the documentation). It is also the most complex, I was unable to get lexical to perform alot of basic functionality at this point, including returning the content as HTML. Likely will need extensive research to impliment at this stage. Lexical is likely overkill for a simple text editor. Like the others, there is no default HTML viewer/editor.
